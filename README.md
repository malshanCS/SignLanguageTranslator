# SignLanguageTranslator

This is a machine learning project that converts sign language into text. The signs that are currently supported include "I love you", "Thank you", "You are welcome", "Hello", "Goodbye", and more.

The project was built using a combination of technologies, including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. The model used is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model implemented in Keras.

This sign language converter is designed to operate in real-time, meaning it can quickly and accurately convert sign language gestures into text as they are being performed. This makes it particularly useful for live communication situations, where there may be a need for quick and accurate translation.
